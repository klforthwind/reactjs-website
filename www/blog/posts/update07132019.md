# Another Update On The Blog
## 07/13/2019

It's been a while since I have posted on this blog, besides the one that I posted this month, and I thought that I should update readers on what has been happening. I have been thinking about this blog some more, and I have contemplated about what information would be going on my blog. At the beginning, the blog was meant to store just computer science information, while trying to keep the text really low. I have decided that I will be adding more lengthy text posts, as I enjoy writing them, while still writing short "cheat sheets" for certain topics. I might end up changing the css, in order for the readers to be able to discern the difference for now, with the possibility of only showing a certain type of blog post in the future.

For those wondering, I have been bogged down with my jobs of employment, although I will be quitting one relatively soon, so I can focus more on learning more about the computer science field. I am happy to say that my computer workspaces have been staying relatively clean, since I have found that using a clean workspace deters me from getting distracted. Hopefully, I will be posting once a day, in order to stick with the mindset of being able to write while handling other daily tasks and work.

Sorry for the rant. Thank you for being here! Hope you are enjoying the blog!

:)
