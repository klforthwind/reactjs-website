OSI (Open Source Interconnection) 7 Layer Model

Layer Seven: Application

* Serves as the window for users and application processes to access the network services.
* Application: End User layer- Program that opens what was sent or creates what is to be sent
* Examples:
    * Resource sharing
    * Remote file access
    * Remote printer access
    * Directory services
    * Network management
* Central Device / Protocols
    * User Applications
    * SMTP
    * Gateway
* DOD4 Model: Process
Layer Six: Presentation
* Formats the data to be presented to the Application layer. It can be viewed as the "translator" for the network.
* Application: Syntax layer- encrypt and decrypt (if needed)
* Examples:
    * Character code translation
    * Data conversion
    * Data compression
    * Data encryption
    * Character Set Translation
* Central Device / Protocols
    * JPEG
    * ASCII
    * EBDIC
    * TIFF
    * GIF
    * PICT
    * Gateway
* DOD4 Model: Process

Layer Five: Session

* Allows session establishment between processes running on different stations. 
* Application: Sync and send to ports (logical ports)
* Examples:
    * Session establishment
    * Maintenance and termination
    * Session support
    * Perform security
    * Name recognition
    * Logging
* Central Device / Protocols
    * Logical Ports
    * RPC
    * SQL
    * NFS
    * NetBIOS names
    * Gateway
* DOD4 Model: Process

Layer Four: Transport

* Ensures that messages are delivered error-free, in sequence, and with no losses or duplications.
* Application: TCP- Host to Host, Flow Control
* Examples:
    * Message segmentation
    * Message acknowledgement
    * Message traffic control
    * Session multiplexing
    * Packet filtering
* Central Device / Protocols
    * TCP
    * SPX
    * UDP
    * Gateway
* DOD4 Model: Host to Host

Layer Three: Network

* Controls the operations of the subnet, deciding which physical path the data takes.
* Application: Packets ("letter", contains IP address)
* Examples:
    * Routing
    * Subnet traffic control
    * Frame fragmentation
    * Logical-physical address mapping
    * Subnet usage accounting
    * Packet Filtering
* Central Device / Protocols
    * Routers
    * IP
    * IPX
    * ICMP
    * Gateway
* DOD4 Model: Internet

Layer Two: Data Link

* Provides error-free transfer of data frames from one node to another over the Physical layer.
* Application: Frames ("envelopes", contains MAC address) [NIC card--Switch--NIC card] (end to end)
* Examples:
    * Establishes and terminates the logical link between nodes
    * Frame traffic control
    * Frame sequencing
    * Frame acknowledgement
    * Frame delimiting
    * Frame error checking
    * Media access control
* Central Device / Protocols
    * Switch Bridge WAP
    * PPP
    * SLIP
    * Land Based Layer
    * Gateway
* DOD4 Model: Network

Layer One: Physical

* Concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over the physical medium.
* Application: Physical structure- Cables, hubs, etc.
* Examples:
    * Data Encoding
    * Physical medium attachment
    * Transmission technique
    * Baseband or Broadband
    * Phyiscal medium transmission
    * Bits and Volts
* Central Device / Protocols
    * Hub
    * Land Based Layer
    * Gateway
* DOD4 Model: Network
