# Update On The Blog
## 05/30/2019

I would just like to say a couple things about this blog, since things totally went where I did not expect them too. The goal of this blog was for me to express my knowledge, along with providing resources towards those who would possibly need that help. Each blog post was going to be as short as possible, as to differentiate my blog from others, along with promoting the fact that it was different than others. My blog will **always** be ad-free, since I personally do not like ads, and that would deter readers. Given that my blog posts have not been as short as I would have liked them to be, as I have found this blog as an amazing place to spend time writing, I will hopefully be spending time towards summarizing information in this blog, although I will have to see how often I should be doing that. Each summarization would in turn have all of the information covered, without the blocks of text that I enjoy writing, along with having links to the links that are important because of the text covered.

Sorry for that big block of text, hopefully I will never see a block of text that big again on this blog, but you never know what could happen on this blog. Hopefully people are enjoying this blog, or at least they do not hate it :P. If not, then I am happy that I am not hating this blog :P

(Let me know at kl.forthwind@gmail.com if you have suggestions on anything.)

Thanks for being here!
