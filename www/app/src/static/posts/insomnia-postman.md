# Insomnia / Postman
## 05/31/2019

Using [Node Express](https://www.klforthwind.com/blog/?page=node-express "Node Express") and [Python Flask Api](https://www.klforthwind.com/blog/?page=rest-flask-python "Python REST Api") towards making a REST api is really cool, although using the browser for HTTP requests is somewhat limited, as the main request used when accessing a url will be the GET request. That is where Insomnia and Postman come in.

Insomnia and Postman both allow for the user to do HTTP requests to the api other than GET requests. AKA Insomnia and Postman can do PUT, POST, DELETE, etc. requests to the api. Personally, I prefer Insomnia over Postman, as it is much simpler than Postman, although Postman has much more features than Insomnia, along with tutorials towards showing how it is done.

In Insomnia, there is a button on the left that allows the user to create a request, which you can name it whatever you want it to be, along with changing the type of the request. After pressing create, you can enter the url to the api into Insomnia, allowing Insomnia to do an HTTP request to the api.

Postman works mostly the same, although there are more options, so it might be scarier looking compared to Insomnia. Personally I would use Insomnia because it is simple to learn, although Postman would win because of its various features.
